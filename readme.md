# Menu Master

Imagine you are sitting in a fancy and elegant restaurant, but you don't understand the menu because of the obscure entree names. How awkward and uncomfortable! So, my goal is to provide a fast and easy way of helping people to figure out confusing food names. Basically, this application allows people to use phone's camera to scan a menu and it will detect texts in that menu and highlight them. Then users can choose some of the highlighted food names which them want to know, and with just clicks on some of the highlighted food names in your screen, this app will show pictures, ingredients, and all other useful information regarding those foods in your screen. Instead of typing and googling, this application gives people a more convenient and rapid way to know foods with convoluted names by just using phone's camera.
